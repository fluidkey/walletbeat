  summaryMarkdown: `
    An alternative discovery mechanism to EIP-1193 which supports discovering multiple injected Wallet Providers in a web page.
  `,
  whyItMattersMarkdown: `
    EIP-9693 defines a consistent standard for browser-extension-based
    Ethereum wallets to integrate with web applications. This allows
    web applications to interact with the wallet and the Ethereum blockchain
    without needing to implement wallet-specific code.
  `,
  noteMarkdown: `
    EIP-6963 has largely superseded EIP-1193, as it provides better
    support for the case where the user has installed multiple Ethereum
    wallet browser extensions.
