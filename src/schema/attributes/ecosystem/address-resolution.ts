  question: sentence(`
    Can you send funds to human-readable Ethereum addresses?
  `),
  why: markdown(`
    Ethereum addresses are hexadecimal strings (\`0x...\`) which are
    unreadable to humans. Phishing scams and exploits have used this to
    trick users into sending funds to invalid addresses, for example by
    generating lookalike-addresses and tricking users into copy/pasting
    them without noticing the difference.

    Additionally, Ethereum's transition to layer 2s has changed user needs
    when sending funds. The hexadecimal address isn't sufficient anymore;
    the user needs to ensure that they are sending funds to the correct
    hexadecimal address *on the correct chain*, increasing the potential
    for mistakenly sending funds to the wrong place or the wrong chain.

    Address naming registries like ENS partially solve this problem by
    allowing more human-readable names like \`username.eth\` to be
    automatically turned into the hexadecimal address. This is easier to
    share and to accurately transfer by humans. Additionally, some address
    format standards improve upon this further by including the destination
    chain information as part of the address itself. Such standards include:

    * ${eipMarkdownLinkAndTitle(erc7828)}: \`user@l2chain.eth\`
    * ${eipMarkdownLinkAndTitle(erc7831)}: \`user.eth:l2chain\`

    Wallets that support either of these standards are able to automatically
    determine the destination address and chain from a human-readable string,
    and can bridge funds across chains as appropriate. This improves the user
    experience of Ethereum and its layer 2 ecosystem while reducing the
    potential for mistakes when sending funds.
  `),
  methodology: markdown(`
    Wallets are rated based on the types of addresses they support sending
    funds to.

    Specifically, Walletbeat recognizes the following destination address
    formats:

    * Plain ENS addresses (\`username.eth\`) without destination chain information
    * ${eipMarkdownLinkAndTitle(erc7828)}: \`user@l2chain.eth\`
    * ${eipMarkdownLinkAndTitle(erc7831)}: \`user.eth:l2chain\`

    Wallets must resolve *either* ERC-7828 or ERC-7831 addresses to fulfill this
    attribute. Support for plain ENS addresses alone earns a partial rating.

    Additionally, the mechanism used to do the resolution must either:

    * Be done using onchain data and reusing the wallet's common chain
      interaction client, inheriting its verifiability (via light client)
      and privacy properties.
    * **OR** be done using an offchain third-party provider in such a way that
      the address returned by the third-party provider is verifiable, and
      without revealing the user's IP address to the provider. This ensures
      that the wallet cannot be tricked into sending funds to an attacker
      compromising the offchain provider's responses, and that the provider
      may not progressively learn the user's contacts list by associating its
      successive resolution queries by IP over time.
