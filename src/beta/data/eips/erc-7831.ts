    Chain-specific address format that allows specifying both an
    account and the chain on which that account intends to transact.
    Chain-specific addresses take the form of \`user.eth:l2chain\`.
    The target chain is resolved using a registry stored on ENS.

  whyItMattersMarkdown: `
    This address format ensures Ethereum addresses specify the chain of the
    recipient. This fits well in Ethereum's layer-2 roadmap to reduce user
    errors such as accidentally sending funds on the wrong chain, and for
    wallets to automatically bridge funds to the intended destination chain.
