  question: sentence(`
    Can a third-party learn that your various wallet addresses belong to the same person?
  `),
  why: paragraph(`
    You probably have more than one wallet address configured in your wallet,
    which you use for different purposes and perhaps as different identities.
    These wallet addresses all belong to you, but you would rather keep that
    fact private.
    It is therefore important to use a wallet that does not reveal that fact.
  `),
  methodology: markdown(`
    Wallets are assessed based on whether a third-party can learn that
    two or more of the user's wallet addresses belong to the same user.

    A third-party may learn of this correlation either through the wallet
    software explicitly sending this data (e.g. through analytics), or by
    requesting data about multiple wallet addresses in bulk, which allows
    the receiving endpoint to learn that all of these addresses belong to
    the same user. Similar correlations are also possible by IP and/or
    time-based correlation of requests that each contain one wallet address.

    In order to prevent this information from being revealed, wallets can
    use a variety of strategies:

    * Wallets may offer the user to only have one active wallet address at
      a time, and only ever makes requests about the active wallet address.
      The user is expected to not change their active address often.
      The wallet should also ensure that any account-switching widget does
      not cause bulk/simultaneous requests about multiple addresses to the
      same endpoint, such as for refreshing balances.
      Note that this scheme, while simple to implement, is incompatible with
      stealth addresses. This is because stealth addresses inherently require
      the user to simultaneously manage a range of addresses.
    * Wallets may look up information about multiple addresses by splitting
      up the requests such that each request only contains one address, then
      sending these requests over different proxy circuits in a manner that
      staggers the requests over time. This ensures that the receiving
      endpoint cannot correlate addressed based on timing or IP address.
    * Wallets may distribute requests across multiple RPC endpoints owned by
      separate entities for each wallet address, preventing each entity from
      learning more than one wallet address.
