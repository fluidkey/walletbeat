  question: sentence(`
    Is your wallet address linkable to other information about yourself?
  `),
  why: paragraph(`
    Your wallet address is unique and permanent, which makes it easy for
    applications and companies like Chainalysis to track your activity.
    In web-privacy terms, it is worse than cookies: its record is permanent,
    publicly visible, and even tracks across multiple devices and websites.
    The more personal information is linkable to your wallet address, the
    more effective such tracking can be.
    It is therefore important to use a wallet that does its best to protect
    your information from being linked to your wallet address.
  `),
  methodology: markdown(`
    In order to qualify for a perfect rating on wallet address privacy, a
    wallet must not, *by default*, allow any third-party to link your wallet
    address to any personal information.

    As Walletbeat only considers the wallet's *default* behavior, wallets may
    still choose to offer features that allow third-parties to link wallet
    addresses with personal information, so long as this is done with explicit
    user opt-in.

    To determine this, Walletbeat looks at the network requests made by
    wallets in their default configuration, and the contents of such requests.
    If a request contains the user's wallet address, we look at whether it
    also contains any other personal information, such as the user's name,
    pseudonym, email address, phone number, CEX account information, etc.

    Additionally, if such a request is not proxied, then it inherently reveals
    the user's IP address and ties it with the user's wallet address, which is
    also personal information.
