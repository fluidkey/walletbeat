 * If a wallet has one or more monetization strategies, but all or some of

 * revenue, then the wallet is deemed "extractive".
 * This is better than "unclear", because at least the funding sources are

  question: sentence(`
    How is the wallet's development team funded?
  `),
  why: paragraph(`
    Wallets are complex, high-stakes pieces of software. They must be
    maintained, regularly audited, and follow the continuous improvements
    in the ecosystem.
    This requires a reliable, transparent source of funding.
  `),
  methodology: markdown(`
    Wallets are assessed based on how sustainable, transparent, and
    user-aligned their funding mechanisms are.

    Wallets are typically funded by one or more of the following methods:

    * Self-funding from developers
    * Seeking donations from users
    * Seeking grants from foundations
    * Venture capital funding
    * Charging fees on convenience functions (e.g. swapping and bridging
      tokens)
    * Governance tokens
    * Commemorative NFT sales

    Walletbeat looks at each funding source of funding and verifies whether
    it is done transparently and in a user-aligned manner. In this context,
    "user alignment" refers to whether a source of funding grows as a
    function of the user's own goals, rather than being uncorrelated or
    anti-correlated. For example, funding acquired through hidden swap fees
    or governance token sales with undisclosed insider token allocations are
    not user-aligned. Funding acquired through transparent swap fees, user
    donations, or ecosystem grants are user-aligned.

    In order to pass this criterion, wallets must have at least one source of
    funding, and all of their sources of funding must be transparent to users.
    Additionally, if the wallet is funded from multiple sources and some of
    these sources are not user-aligned, the public must be able to determine
    the proportion of each such funding source to the wallet's overall
    revenue. Depending on the funding mechanism, this can be done through
    publication of a revenue breakdown page, public regulatory filings,
    or token allocation and vesting disclosures.
